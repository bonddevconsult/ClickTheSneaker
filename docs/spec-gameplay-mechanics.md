# Specification for Implementing Gameplay Mechanics in "Click The Sneaker"

## Objective
Develop the core gameplay mechanics for "Click The Sneaker," where sneakers fall from the top of the screen, and players click them to score points. The gameplay should feature smooth animations, touch interactions, and a clean UI.

---

## Components

### 1. `Sneaker` Component

#### Purpose
Represents a falling sneaker that players can click to score points.

#### Props
- `position` (Object): The x and y coordinates of the sneaker.
  - `x` (Number): Horizontal position.
  - `y` (Number): Vertical position.
- `onClick` (Function): Callback function triggered when the sneaker is clicked.

#### Behavior
- Displays an image of a sneaker.
- Moves smoothly from the top to the bottom of the screen using React Native's `Animated` API.
- Detects touch events and triggers the `onClick` callback.

#### Edge Cases
- Ensure the sneaker stops animating if it goes off-screen.
- Handle rapid clicks to prevent multiple triggers.

---

### 2. `GameScreen` Component

#### Purpose
Manages the game state, spawns sneakers, and handles user interactions.

#### State
- `sneakers` (Array): List of active sneakers.
  - Each sneaker has:
    - `id` (String): Unique identifier.
    - `position` (Object): Current x and y coordinates.
- `score` (Number): The player's current score.

#### Behavior
- Spawns sneakers at random intervals and positions.
- Updates the position of each sneaker over time.
- Removes sneakers when clicked or when they go off-screen.
- Increments the score when a sneaker is clicked.

#### Methods
- `spawnSneaker`: Adds a new sneaker to the `sneakers` state.
- `updateSneakerPositions`: Updates the position of all sneakers.
- `handleSneakerClick`: Removes a clicked sneaker and increments the score.

#### Edge Cases
- Prevent overlapping sneakers by ensuring random positions do not collide.
- Handle performance issues when many sneakers are active.

## Animations

### Falling Animation
- Use `Animated.timing` to move sneakers from the top to the bottom of the screen.
- Adjust the duration based on the difficulty level.

### Click Feedback
- Add a brief scaling animation when a sneaker is clicked.

---

## Assets
- Sneaker image (`sneaker.png`): Required for the `Sneaker` component.

---

## Error Handling
- Log errors if a sneaker fails to spawn or animate.
- Display a fallback UI if the game state fails to load.

---

## Assumptions
- The screen dimensions are fixed and accessible via `Dimensions` from React Native.
- The game runs at a consistent frame rate.

---

## Limitations
- The current implementation does not include difficulty progression or obstacles.
- Sound effects and settings are not part of this specification.

---

## Testing
- Verify that sneakers spawn at random positions and intervals.
- Ensure the score increments correctly when sneakers are clicked.
- Test animations for smoothness and responsiveness.
- Validate edge cases, such as overlapping sneakers and rapid clicks.
