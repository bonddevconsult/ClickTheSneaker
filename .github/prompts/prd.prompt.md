I want to build an app. My idea is a mobile app called Click The Sneaker where a randomized number of sneakers falls at a random rate of speed from the top of the on the screen, and the player must click it to score a point.
I want to use this app to help people improve their reaction time and have fun while doing it. The app will be simple, yet engaging, with a clean UI and smooth animations.
I want the app to get increasingly difficult as the player progresses, with faster falling sneakers and more obstacles to avoid.

Let's join forces to make this idea into a simple, yet impactful proposal.

FIRST:
- Clarify any areas of my proposal that may need more details
- Suggest new requirements based on the functionality provided
- Consider edge cases that may not be included in my original proposal.
- Organize requirements logically, and break them down into units that would make sense as user stories.
- Raise any important high-level technical considerations, like platforms, languages, frameworks, and overall architecture details
- Use react-native as the framework for cross-platform developmennt

NEXT:
- Iterate with me until I tell you I am satisfied.

FINALLY:
- Once I tell you I am ready, create a plan (or update an existing plan) and use the #tool:github create issue tool to create an issue with this proposal and title: Spec.

The correct repo is bonddevconsult/ClickTheSneaker
